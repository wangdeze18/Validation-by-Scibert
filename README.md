Validation-by-Scibert
===============================
1 Introduction
--------------
This repository is to illustrate the difference between DComment("Deep Code-Comment Understanding and Assessment") and general text classification model. We compare our model with the state-of-the-art scientific text classification model [Scibert](https://paperswithcode.com/task/sentence-classification).

2 Dataset
--------------
We use the public code-comment [dataset](http://www2.unibas.it/gscanniello/coherence/). All data is converted into json format in `preprocess/`.

3 Result
--------------
To run Scibert on the public code-comment dataset, use the script in `script/` instead of the original.

The simplified version of the output log is in `output/`. More detailed model and output can be downloaded [here]().
